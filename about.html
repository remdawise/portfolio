        <p class="statement"><b>Rem Wise, 2025, Junior</b><br>Most often I gravitate towards pencil, charcoal, or oil pastel. It feels the most impermanent. It is easy to make the most mistakes, to smudge the page, or make an irreversible mistake. Even when a work is “done,” these materials still live on, constantly threatening to change a piece long after it has left the mind of the artist. My work is a conversation to a human, one who could only understand a fingerprint or the smudges of color from an oil pastel on the hand. I often work without an explicit goal or message and let myself guide the piece. I work from my mind rather than a reference. I want to create something that represents myself, who I am, how I think. To know me without speaking–that is my goal.</p>
